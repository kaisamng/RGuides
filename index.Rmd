# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is your 1-Stop-Shop for the RS1 with R course. Materials and format here are heavily inspired and borrowed from the [Preceptor's Primer for Bayesian Data Science](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/) and *The Practice of Statistics, 4th Ed* by Starnes, Yates, and Moore.

Almost everything else was written by Mr. Ng and Mr. McFee.
