# Preface {.unnumbered}

This website serves as a digital companion for TJ students taking the RS1 class. Materials and format here are heavily inspired and borrowed from @kane2022, @heiss_2022, and @starnes_yates_moore_2012. LearnR and related javascript magic was inspired by @de_leon_2022.

Almost everything else was written by Mr. Ng and Mr. McFee.
