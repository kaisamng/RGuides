# RGuides

This is Mr. Ng's latest summer project. After, Mr. Ng's last summer project, automating his entire apartment with Home Assistant, annoyed his wife alot ("why can't I just turn on a light like a normal person?"), this project will hopefully be less disruptive.

It is silly and maybe a little too ambitious, but hopefully this will serve as a "digital textbook" for the RS1 course next year. Hopefully, I didn't bite off more than I can chew.
