# Creating Dataframes

### Combining Vectors into Dataframes

If you aren't reading in data from a file and you have some vectors of information you'd like combined into a single data frame, you can use the `data.frame` function:

```{r}
friends <- data.frame(names = friend_names,
           ages = friend_ages,
           DC_Resident = lives_in_dc,
           stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
friends
```

Here we have created a `names` variable in the `friends` data frame that corresponds to the values in the `friend_names` vector and similarly an `ages` variable in `friends` that corresponds to the values in `friend_ages`.

### Importing an Excel or CVS File into R as a Data frame

**XLSX** and **CSV** files are how many places will store data, that open through the Excel app. You can tell that they are Excel from their icon:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/00-Getting-Started/XLSX_File.png") 
```

You can open these files in Excel to preview the data, but for more serious data analysis, and better control of charts and graphics, we can import them into R.

Before you continue, run this command:

```{r}
getwd()
```

Whenever we manipulate a file in R, R assumes that the file is within your **working directory**. Think of the working directory as your desk. If you left your math homework at your desk at home, and you need your mom to take a picture of your work, you need to tell her where you left it.

Unless you give the exact path to a file, R will always assume you are referencing a file in the working directory. For example, on FCPS computers, your default working directory is **Documents**. If you download a CSV file `data.csv`, it automatically goes to your **Downloads** folder instead. To import into Excel, you can only import it with `data.csv` if you move it into your **Documents** folder.

To set your working directory, go to the R Studio Menu \> Session \> Set Working Directory \> Choose Directory.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/00-Getting-Started/setwd.png") 
```

We **strongly suggest** that, once you download your data file, you move it into a folder dedicated to that purpose-- call it "IBET Project" or "RS1 Unit 1 Project" or whatever-- inside your *Documents* folder.

**Do not use OneDrive or Google Drive.** These services will mess up your data.

Importing the dataset itself is easy.

-   **XLSX**: Go to the menu > File > Import Dataset > From Excel.
-   **CSV**: Go to menu > File > Import Dataset > From Text (readr).

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/00-Getting-Started/Import_1.png") 
```

1.  In this case, I am using the anime dataset. Click on "browse" to find the file that you want to import into R.

2.  If everything looks good, click **Import** at the bottom right of the window.

    a.  If you want the name of the dataset when it's stored, do that on the bottom left of the window.

3.  You should now have your dataset imported. Verify that it is correctly imported, on the top right.
