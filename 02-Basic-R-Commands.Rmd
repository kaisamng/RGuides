# Using R

### Basic Commands

Before we get started, there are a few terms, tips, and tricks that you should know before getting started with R.

* *Functions*: these perform tasks by taking an input called an *argument* and returning an output. Take a look at the example below.

```{r}
sqrt(64)
```

`sqrt()` is a function that gives us the square root of the argument. 64 is the argument. Therefore, the output should be 8. Try it for yourself in the console!

* *Help files*: these provide documentation for functions and datasets. You can bring up help files by adding a `?` before the name of the object then run this in the console. The `ggplot2` package is where a lot of the functions we will use for graphing will be located. Run `?ggplot2` in the console and see what pops up.

* *Code comments*: these are text placed after a `#` symbol. Nothing will be run after a `#` symbol, which is useful when you include comments in your code, as you always should. The image below shows what a code comment looks like.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/00-Getting-Started/code-comment.png")
```

* *Errors, warnings, and messages*: these generally reported in a red font. When there is an error, the code will not run. Read (and/or Google) the message and try fix it. Warnings don't prevent code from completing. For example, if you create a scatterplot based on data with two missing values, you will see this warning: 
  ````
  Warning message:
  Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).  
  ````
  Messages are similar. In both cases, you should fix the underlying issue until the warning/message goes away.
